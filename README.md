# LightNet: A Versatile, Standalone Matlab-based Environment for Deep Learning

LightNet is a lightweight, versatile and purely Matlab-based deep learning framework. The aim of the design is to provide an easy-to-understand, easy-to-use and efficient computational platform for deep learning research. The implemented framework supports major deep learning architectures such as the Multilayer Perceptron Networks (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The framework also supports both CPU and GPU for computation and the switch between them is straightforward. Different applications in computer vision, natural language processing and robotics are demonstrated as experiments.

## How to use LightNet

The documentation can be found in the Documentation folder.

The major examples start with "Main*", the code is mostly written in a self-explanatory way. Have fun!
