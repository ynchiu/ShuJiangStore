LightNet is a lightweight, versatile and purely Matlab-based deep learning framework. The aim of the design is to provide an easy-to-understand, easy-to-use and efficient computational platform for deep learning research. The implemented framework supports major deep learning architectures such as the Multilayer Perceptron Networks (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). LightNet supports both CPU and GPU for computation and the switch between them is straightforward. Different applications in computer vision, natural language processing and robotics are demonstrated as experiments.

## How to use LightNet

Install the latest Matlab R2016a on a computer with an Nvidia GPU (at least 3GB GPU memory), and run the RunAll.m Matlab script.

## Recent updates

RNN (with skip links) and GRU are added to the RNN directory. 

LightNet now supports using pretrained ImageNet network models.

Convolutions can be accelerated with CUDNN thanks to the work from the MatConvNet team.

## How to accelerate LightNet

CUDNN can be used to calculate convolutions. You will need to compile the vl_nnconv function provided by MatConvNet team.  

1. Please go to http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/install/ to download.
2. Copy the folder 'MatConvNet_Dir/matlab' into 'LightNet_Dir/CoreModules/matlab'.
3. Try to compile MatConvNet in the LightNet directory (even though we only use one convolution function).   
4. Set opts.use_cudnn=1 in the main tesing script.
