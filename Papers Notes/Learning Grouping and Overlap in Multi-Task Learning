title: Learning Grouping and Overlap in Multi-Task Learning 论文笔记
tags: 论文笔记，多任务学习

中心思想： 
* Our method is based on the assumtion that task parameters within a group lie in a low dimensional subspace but allows the tasks in different groups to overlaap with each other in one or more based. 意思就是说同一个group的参数都会在同一个低纬度的子空间。但是也允许不同group的task有所重叠。

* This is in contrast to the approach proposed in this paper, where the low dimensional subspace shared by group members is not allowed to exclusive to it, and two tasks from different groups are allowed to overlap in one or more bases. 学习到的参数并不是单个任务独有的，而是允许其他任务共同使用一个或者多个子空间的基。
